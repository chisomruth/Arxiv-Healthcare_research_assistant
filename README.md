### AI in HEALTHCARE RESEARCH WRITTING CHATBOT
This repository contains the project I built as a sample implementation for RAG Applications while working as a Data Science intern at SAIL Innovation Lab.
It has several functionalities, and was deployed using streaamlit. The chatbot is able to generate AI in healthcare research writing content based on over 200 scraped Arxiv papers.
This project is still undergoing development and will be expanded and updated along with my learning curve.
